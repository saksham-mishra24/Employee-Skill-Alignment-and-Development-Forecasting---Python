#  Employee Skill Alignment and Development Forecasting
## Objective


This project aims to help workforce management in the technology sector by leveraging machine learning to predict future skill requirements model, optimize training programs, and align employee assignments with project needs. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it identifies patterns in employee skill evolution, project assignments, and training success rates to provide actionable insights that enhance productivity, retention, and readiness for future challenges.

## **So, what can you expect from this project?** 

- First, we’ll generate predictive insights to pinpoint which skills employees will need in the near future.  
- Then, we’ll fine-tune how training programs and project assignments are managed to make the most of everyone’s potential.  
- On top of that, we’ll develop strategies to help retain top talent.  

Here’s how we’ll get there:  
1. **Predictive Model:** A smart system that forecasts the skills employees will need over the next year, helping teams stay ahead of the curve.  
2. **EDA Insights:** A deep dive into skill development trends, showing how they influence project success and employee retention.  
3. **Actionable Insights:** Clear, practical recommendations for training and project management teams to optimize workflows and drive success.
