# Employee-Skill-Alignment-and-Development-Forecasting - Python


## Objective
Create a predictive model that identifies technology employees' future skill requirements and aligns training programs accordingly. This includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in employee skill evolution, project assignments, and training success rates.

## Key Features
1. **Skill Gap Analysis:** Identify skill gaps among employees based on current and upcoming projects.
2. **Training Program Recommendation:** Predict which training programs would most benefit employees based on their career trajectories and current performance.
3. **Employee Retention Insight:** Understand how skill development impacts employee retention rates in the technology sector.
4. **Project Assignment Optimization:** Match employees to projects based on predicted skill acquisition and team needs.

## Development Timeline
| Task                        | Duration |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Data Collection and Cleaning| 3 days   |
| EDA and Visualization       | 4 days   |
| Model Development           | 5 days   |
| Model Evaluation and Insights | 2 days |

## Tools Used
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization Tools:** Power BI or Tableau for dashboard creation
- **Optional Frameworks:** TensorFlow or PyTorch for advanced forecasting
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes anonymized records from a fictional technology company with the following attributes:
- `Employee_ID`, `Department`, `Current Skills`, `Certification History`
- `Training Programs Attended`, `Project Assignments`, `Skill Ratings`
- `Tenure`, `Job Role`, `Promotion History`, `Retention Status`
- `Project Complexity`, `Required Skills`, `Future Skill Forecasts`

## Usage
1. Perform EDA to analyze trends in employee skill development and project success.
2. Build a machine learning model to predict future skill requirements for employees based on historical project data and training outcomes.
3. Create a dashboard to display insights, including skill gap summaries, training recommendations, and project assignment forecasts.

## Results
1. **Predictive Model:** A model capable of forecasting skills employees will likely need within the next year.
2. **EDA Insights:** Analysis of skill development trends and their impact on project success rates and employee retention.
3. **Actionable Insights:** Training recommendations and project optimization strategies for the HR and project management teams.

## Business Impact
1. Reduces project risks by ensuring skill alignment with project requirements.
2. Improves employee satisfaction and retention through targeted development programs.
3. Enhances organizational efficiency by optimizing resource allocation in the technology sector.

## Unique Aspect
This project combines skill forecasting, retention analysis, and project optimizationâ€”offering a holistic approach to workforce management in the tech industry.
